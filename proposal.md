# Major Project Proposal
I would like to make a sidescrolling adventure game. This would involve moving right and left and attacking monsters that spawn in from the left. It would be infinite.

## Need To Have List
- Movement from left to right
- Random monster generation
- A combat system with an attack and a block
- Monster AI to some degree (knows when to attack and when to block)
- Some form of progression (gold dropped is used for upgrades)
- Music
- Retro style graphics

## Nice To Have List
- More attack/defense options
- More monsters
- Progressive difficulty
- Sound effects for attacking and blocking
- better graphics overall
- Smooth animation
- Boss enemy(s)
- Background
