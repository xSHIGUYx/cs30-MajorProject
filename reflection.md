#Issues I Faced During My Game
-Animation of sprites
-Damage Collisions
-Language Knowledge

##Solutions
-Since I had no way to just plug the sprites into some type of function, I made an animation loop for each situation. This was a decent way to go about things, however I would have prefered to make an "animate" function. I tried multiple times and could not get one to work with every scenario, so I gave up and continued on with hand making each type of scenario.
-For damage collisions I originally had multiple issues with pixel perfecting everything. However, when I changed over to using the collide library everything became quite easy. I also stuck the hitboxes being created in their own class. This system means that I can add as many attacks to the main character and enemies as I want, however I ran out of time figuring it all out.
-Javascript is not my favorite, or first choice for a programming language. It is not made for making games, and thus was very difficult to get around in. Even though I do feel that I probably could've made something greater with a little better time management, I still felt very awkward using it all nonetheless.
-My favorite part was watching it all start to fall into place at the end. After getting the hitbox class set up and figuring out animation, it was simply a time crunch to fit it all together.
